    "<p>On planet J, a year lasts for $D$ days. Holidays are defined by the two following rules.</p>\n",
    "<ol><li>At the beginning of the reign of the current Emperor, his birthday is declared a holiday from that year onwards.</li>\n",
    "<li>If both the day before and after a day $d$ are holidays, then $d$ also becomes a holiday.</li>\n",
    "</ol><p>Initially there are no holidays. Let $E(D)$ be the expected number of Emperors to reign before all the days of the year are holidays, assuming that their birthdays are independent and uniformly distributed throughout the $D$ days of the year.</p>\n",
