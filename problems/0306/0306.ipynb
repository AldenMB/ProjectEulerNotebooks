    "<p>The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Two players start with a strip of $n$ white squares and they take alternate turns.<br />\n",
    "On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.<br />\n",
    "The first player who cannot make a move loses.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul><li>$n = 1$: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.</li>\n",
    "<li>$n = 2$: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.</li>\n",
    "<li>$n = 3$: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.</li>\n",
    "<li>$n = 4$: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to win the game by painting the two middle squares.</li>\n",
    "<li>$n = 5$: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red), but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue) wins.</li>\n",
    "</ul><div style=\"text-align: center !important\"><img src=\"p306_pstrip.gif\" class=\"dark_img\" alt=\"p306_pstrip.gif\" /></div>\n",
