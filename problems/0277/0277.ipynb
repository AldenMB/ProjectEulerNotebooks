    "A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value $a_1$ in the following way:</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "$a_{n+1} = \\, \\,\\, \\frac {a_n} 3 \\quad$ if $a_n$ is divisible by $3$. We shall denote this as a large downward step, \"D\".</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "$a_{n+1} = \\frac {4 a_n+2} 3 \\, \\,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $1$. We shall denote this as an upward step, \"U\".\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "$a_{n+1} = \\frac {2 a_n -1} 3 \\, \\,$ if $a_n$ divided by $3$ gives a remainder of $2$. We shall denote this as a small downward step, \"d\".\n",

    "The sequence terminates when some $a_n = 1$.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.<br />\n",
    "For instance if $a_1=231$, then the sequence $\\{a_n\\}=\\{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1\\}$ corresponds to the steps \"DdDddUUdDD\".\n",
