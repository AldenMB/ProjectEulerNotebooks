    "<p>A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.</p>\n",
    "<p>The text file, <a href=\"keylog.txt\">keylog.txt</a>, contains fifty successful login attempts.</p>\n",
