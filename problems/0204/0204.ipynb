    "<p>A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than 5.<br />\n",
    "So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.<br />\n",
    "There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type <var>n</var>, if it has no prime factor larger than <var>n</var>.<br />\n",
    "Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.</p>\n",

    "<p>How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't exceed 10<sup>9</sup>?</p>\n"
