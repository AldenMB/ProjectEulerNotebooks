    "A contiguous range of positive integers is called a <dfn>divisible range</dfn> if all the integers in the range can be arranged in a row such that the $n$-th term is a multiple of $n$.<br>\n",
    "For example, the range $[6..9]$ is a divisible range because we can arrange the numbers as $7,6,9,8$.<br>\n",
    "In fact, it is the $4$th divisible range of length $4$, the first three being $[1..4], [2..5], [3..6]$.</p>\n",
