    "The <i>collapsing process</i> happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:\n",
    "</p><ul><li>No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking $F$.</li>\n",
    "<li>One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $D$.</li>\n",
    "<li>Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking $C$.</li>\n",
    "</ul><p>\n",
    "This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle $A$ in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either $B$ or $C$. If it is filled with $C$ then the space that $C$ creates can be filled with $D$ or $E$. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if $A$ is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.\n",
