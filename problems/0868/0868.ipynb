    "<p>\n",
    "The same method can be used to create all permutations of a set of letters. Consider the letters to be permuted initially in order from smallest to largest. At each step swap the largest letter with the letter on its left or right whichever generates a permutation that has not yet been seen. If neither gives a new permutation then try the next largest letter and so on. This procedure continues until all permutations have been generated.</p><p>\n",
