    "A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \\times n$  \n",
    "board in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.\n",

    "We call such a position an <i>open</i> position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. \n",

    "<p>Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \\times n$ chessboard.<br />\n",
