    "Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of $H\\times W$ nodes. \n",
    "The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.\n",
    "$W$ vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, $H$ horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "Two nodes, $A$ and $B$ in a directed graph, are <b>strongly connected</b> if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from $A$ to $B$ as well as from $B$ to $A$. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "A <b>strongly connected component</b> in a directed graph is a non-empty set $M$ of nodes satisfying the following two properties:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<ul><li>All nodes in $M$ are strongly connected to each other.</li>\n",
    "<li>$M$ is maximal, in the sense that no node in $M$ is strongly connected to any node outside of $M$.</li>\n",
    "</ul><p>\n",
    "There are $2^H\\times 2^W$ ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph $\\mathcal{G}$. We define $S(\\mathcal{G})$ to be the number of strongly connected components in $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
