For example, the three expressions $x$, $\\mathcal{I}(x,y)$, and $\\mathcal{I}(\\mathcal{I}(x,ab),x)$ are all $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions.</p>\n",

    "<p>For two $\\mathcal{I}$-expressions $e_1$ and $e_2$ such that the equation $e_1=e_2$ has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be the minimum value taken by $e_1$ and $e_2$ on such a solution. If the equation $e_1=e_2$ has no solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of $e_1$ and $e_2$ to be $0$.
