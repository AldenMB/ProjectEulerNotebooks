    "Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes <b>THHH—TTTT—THHT—H</b> beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore $2\\times 2\\times 1 = 4$.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Define $e(n, p)$ to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where $n$ is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and $p$ is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "It turns out that, for any fixed $n$, $e(n, p)$ is always a polynomial in $p$. For example, $e(3, p) = p^3 + 4p^2 + p$.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Define $c(n, k)$ to be the coefficient of $p^k$ in the polynomial $e(n, p)$. So $c(3, 1) = 1$, $c(3, 2) = 4$, and $c(3, 3) = 1$.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "You are given that $c(100, 40) \\equiv 986699437 \\text{ } (\\text{mod } 10^9+7)$.\n",

    "Find $c(10000000, 4000000) \\mod 10^9+7$.\n",
