    "Define an <dfn>$n$-star polygon</dfn> as an $n$-gon whose vertices are $n$ equally spaced points on a circle. Two $n$-star polygons differing by a rotation/reflection are considered <strong>different</strong>.</p>\n",

    "<p>\n",
    "For example, there are twelve $5$-star polygons shown below.</p>\n",

    "For an $n$-star polygon $S$, let $I(S)$ be the number of its self intersection points.<br>\n",
    "Let $T(n)$ be the sum of $I(S)$ over all $n$-star polygons $S$.<br>\n",
    "For the example above $T(5) = 20$ because in total there are $20$ self intersection points.</p>\n",

    "Some star polygons may have intersection points made from more than two lines. These are only counted once. For example, <span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">$S$,</span> shown below is one of the sixty $6$-star polygons. This one has $I(S) = 4$.</p>\n",
