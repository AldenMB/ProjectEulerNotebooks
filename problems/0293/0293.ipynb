    "An even positive integer N will be called admissible, if it is a power of 2 or its distinct prime factors are consecutive primes.<br />\n",
    "The first twelve admissible numbers are 2,4,6,8,12,16,18,24,30,32,36,48.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "If N is admissible, the smallest integer M &gt; 1 such that N+M is prime, will be called the pseudo-Fortunate number for N.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "For example, N=630 is admissible since it is even and its distinct prime factors are the consecutive primes 2,3,5 and 7.<br /> \n",
    "The next prime number after 631 is 641; hence, the pseudo-Fortunate number for 630 is M=11.<br />\n",
    "It can also be seen that the pseudo-Fortunate number for 16 is 3.\n",
