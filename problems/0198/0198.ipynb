    "<p>A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\\frac r s$ (in reduced form) with $s \\le d$, so that any rational number $\\frac p q$ which is closer to $x$ than $\\frac r s$ has $q &gt; d$.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. $\\frac 9 {40}$ has the two best approximations $\\frac 1 4$ and $\\frac 1 5$ for the denominator bound $6$.\n",
    "We shall call a real number $x$ <i>ambiguous</i>, if there is at least one denominator bound for which $x$ possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.</p>\n",
