    "<p>A standard $52$ card deck comprises thirteen ranks in four suits. However, modern decks have two additional Jokers, which neither have a suit nor a rank, for a total of $54$ cards. If we shuffle such a deck and draw cards without replacement, then we would need, on average, approximately $29.05361725$ cards so that we have at least one card for each rank.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Now, assume you have $10$ such decks, each with a different back design. We shuffle all $10 \\times 54$ cards together and draw cards without replacement. What is the expected number of cards needed so every suit, rank and deck design have at least one card?</p>\n",
