    "Gary and Sally play a game using gold and silver coins arranged into a number of vertical stacks, alternating turns. On Gary's turn he chooses a gold coin and removes it from the game along with any other coins sitting on top. Sally does the same on her turn by removing a silver coin. The first player unable to make a move loses.</p>\n",
