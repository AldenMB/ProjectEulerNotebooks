    "<p>A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N×N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the <var>x</var>- and <var>y</var>-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:\n",
    "</p><ul><li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>\n",
    "<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>\n",
    "<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>\n",
    "</ul><p>Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N×N square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown below).</p>\n",
