    "<p>The players sit around a table and the game begins with two opposite players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die roll it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>If the player rolls 1, then the die passes to the neighbour on the left.<br />\n",
    "If the player rolls 6, then the die passes to the neighbour on the right.<br />\n",
    "Otherwise, the player keeps the die for the next turn.</p>\n",

    "<p>The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>\n",
