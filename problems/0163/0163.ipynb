    "<p>Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using <i>size 1</i> triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the <i>size 2</i> triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that <i>size 2</i> triangle.</p>\n",
    "<p>It can be observed that the <i>size 2</i> triangle contains 4 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks. A <i>size 3</i> triangle would contain 9 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks and a <i>size n</i> triangle would thus contain <i>n<sup>2</sup> size 1</i> triangle building blocks.</p>\n",
