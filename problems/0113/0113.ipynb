    "<p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p>\n",
    "<p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.</p>\n",
    "<p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a \"bouncy\" number; for example, 155349.</p>\n",
    "<p>As <i>n</i> increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below <i>n</i> increases such that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10<sup>10</sup>.</p>\n",
