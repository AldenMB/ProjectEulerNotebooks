    "A <i>bracelet</i> is made by connecting at least three numbered beads in a circle. Each bead can only display $1$, $2$, or any number of the form $p^k$ or $2p^k$ for odd prime $p$.</p>\n",

    "<p>\n",

    "<li> no two beads display the same number</li>\n",
    "<li> the product of the numbers of any two adjacent beads is of the form $x^2+1$</li>\n",
