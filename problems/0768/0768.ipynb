    "<p>A certain type of chandelier contains a circular ring of $n$ evenly spaced candleholders.<br />\n",
    "If only one candle is fitted, then the chandelier will be imbalanced. However, if a second identical candle is placed in the opposite candleholder (assuming $n$ is even) then perfect balance will be achieved and the chandelier will hang level.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Let $f(n,m)$ be the number of ways of arranging $m$ identical candles in distinct sockets of a chandelier with $n$ candleholders such that the chandelier is perfectly balanced.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>For example, $f(4, 2) = 2$: assuming the chandelier's four candleholders are aligned with the compass points, the two valid arrangements are \"North &amp; South\" and \"East &amp; West\". Note that these are considered to be different arrangements even though they are related by rotation.</p>\n",

    "<p>You are given that $f(12,4) = 15$ and $f(36, 6) = 876$.</p>\n",
