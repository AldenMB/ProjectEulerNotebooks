    "They may only take a number of stones from a pile that is a <dfn title=\"a proper divisor of n is a divisor of n smaller than n\">proper divisor</dfn> of the number of stones present in the pile.<br /> E.g. if a pile at a certain moment contains 24 stones they may take only 1,2,3,4,6,8 or 12 stones from that pile.<br />\n",
    "So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.<br />\n",
