# Project Euler Notebooks

Automatically load each Project Euler problem into its own notebook. The idea of this is to create a repository which is always up-to-date with the latest problems, so that a person can easily make a private fork of the repository and pull in new problems with git. Here are the planned features:

- automatically fetch the problems as well as supporting materials (data sets, images)
- format the problems using Jupyter notebooks, so that it is easy to view the problems alongside attempted solutions
- use Github Actions to fetch new content as it is uploaded, making this fully automatic.
