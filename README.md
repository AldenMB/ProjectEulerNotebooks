# Project Euler Notebooks

Automatically load each Project Euler problem into its own notebook. The idea of this is to create a repository which is always up-to-date with the latest problems, so that a person can easily make a private fork of the repository and pull in new problems with git. So far, the code here successfully copies the problems from Project Euler and formats them into Jupyter notebooks. Some work could be done to improve the formatting in the Jupyter notebooks for some problems, but most problems load just fine. The main remaining task is to use Github Actions to fetch new content as it is uploaded, making this fully automatic.
